            Welcome to my Webpage!
        </p>
        <p>
            I am an avid coder and am excited to write efficient and scalable code.
            I graduated Spring 2020 at the University of Central Missouri with a BS in Computer Science.
            As a student employee, I was a tutor and teaching assistant for Discrete Mathematics.
            I had a three month internship working as a contractor for the United States Air Force where I
            researched Machine Learning solutions to provided problems.
            I am currently seeking full-time employment for software development related positions.

                gato is my senior project that I worked on with a partner. We developed the full-stack for the
                project. I was in charge of developing most of the back-end code and processes. This site allows
                users who have created a profile to interact with the website like a forum. Users can use BBCode
                to format their posts however they like. Users can also have ranks associated with their
                accounts that allow them to take disciplinary action on misbehaving users.

                Domes is a E-Commerce website where a user can order many different varieties of hats by placing
                them in their cart. These hats and their details are all stored in a mysql database where data
                is retrieved by the server. The user interacts with the site by selecting a size and quantity of
                a particular hat and adding it to their cart. The cart dynamically calculates the total cost of
                the order as the user adds and removes items from it. Once the user submits their order,
                shipping information is recorded and stored on the database for a site administrator to view and
                manage. The site also records trends and statistics related to the orders placed.

                Fridge Friend is an Android application I made with a partner that is currently on the play store. It
                allows users to record
                their food products and the respective expiration dates into an SQLite database. The app is designed to
                make the user aware of any near expired food they have. The app also includes a shopping list and
                notepad. The goal of this application was to reduce the
                amount of wasted food that could have otherwise been used. While my partner focused on visual design
                and art, my role in Fridge Friend's development was
                implementing the SQLite database and all interaction and navigation.

                I took a Client-Side Programming course while in college. The last major assignment was to make a word
                guessing game that featured positive and negative feedback based on the user's performance. The project
                was entirely solo. The words are randomly chosen from a hard-coded list in javascript, and increase in
                length as the user guesses correctly. Their score is evaluated based on how many attempts the user takes
                to guess the word correctly. After the user guesses incorrectly three times, the game is over and the
                user is prompted to restart.
