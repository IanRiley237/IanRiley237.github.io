                    Along with the following games, I have also interned with the U.S. Airforce for 10 weeks assisting with the
                    research of machine learning solutions to potential real-world war-time scenarios. During this time, I used
                    the MLAgents library for Unity and spent my time learning about AI and creating several bots to play a
                    supply-chain management game.

                Monkey C was a collaborative project between me and a partner during a Unity course in college. It was
                inspired by the space shooter project that Unity has a tutorial series on at their website. All the
                space ship designs were created by my partner while I implemented the models and their in game behavior.

                Slag was my final project for the Unity course I created Monkey C in. The difference with Slag is that I
                had to create the whole game on my own (Aside from assets I collected online).

                I was lucky enough to attend Texas A&M's yearly gamejam called Chillennium in 2018. My University sent
                one team of four to the Texas A&M campus to participate. That year's theme was "Transformation". Our
                idea was to have the player be a druid that can transform into different animals to solve puzzles.
                Unfortunately, our team did not use any organized version control. This caused us to spend needless time
                fixing compatibility errors involved with moving assets around. The final build of our game is broken
                and incomplete, but I am very happy to have had that experience.
