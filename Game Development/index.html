                    Along with the following games, I have also interned with the U.S. Airforce for 10 weeks assisting with the
                    research of machine learning solutions to potential real-world war-time scenarios. During this time, I used
                    the MLAgents library for Unity and spent my time learning about AI and creating several bots to play a
                    supply-chain management game.

                Monkey C was a collaborative project between me and a partner during a Unity course in college. It was
                inspired by the space shooter project that Unity has a tutorial series on at their website. All the
                space ship designs were created by my partner while I implemented the models and their in game behavior.

                I am currently exploring Unreal Engine 5 with the aspiration to make a complete game to ship. I got started by building an endlessly generating realm of cubes for the player to explore.
                It currently isn't much, but I have already learned so much about Unreal and am elated to have the opportunity to learn more.
                I look forward to how far I can take it.

                I was lucky enough to attend Texas A&M's yearly gamejam called Chillennium in 2018. My University sent
                one team of four to the Texas A&M campus to participate. That year's theme was "Transformation". Our
                idea was to have the player be a druid that can transform into different animals to solve puzzles.
                Unfortunately, our team did not use any organized version control. This caused us to spend needless time
                fixing compatibility errors involved with moving assets around. The final build of our game is broken
                and incomplete, but I am very happy to have had that experience.

                Inspired by the games by Bennete Foddy, I wanted to create a kind of game that was unique in the way that the player moved around. In this game, the player moves around by pointing a leg toward a surface, and propelling their foot into the surface to launch their body in the desired direction.

                For now, there is no real goal in the game. It is just a proof of concept. Click the title text of this card to view the controlls and click the image to view the repo!

                I took a Client-Side Programming course while in college. The last major assignment was to make a word
                guessing game that featured positive and negative feedback based on the user's performance. The project
                was entirely solo. The words are randomly chosen from a hard-coded list in javascript, and increase in
                length as the user guesses correctly. Their score is evaluated based on how many attempts the user takes
                to guess the word correctly. After the user guesses incorrectly three times, the game is over and the
                user is prompted to restart.
